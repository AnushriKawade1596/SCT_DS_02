# SCT_DS_02 - Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset

## Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand patterns and relationships between passenger features and survival.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle (Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster)
- File: train.csv

## Steps Performed
- Data loading and inspection
- Missing value analysis
- Univariate analysis of categorical and numerical variables
- Bivariate analysis of features with respect to survival
- Visualization of key patterns

## Key Observations
- Female passengers had higher survival rates than males
- Passengers in higher classes showed better survival outcomes
- Most passengers paid lower fares, with a few high-fare outliers
- Age distribution shows most passengers were young to middle-aged

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
